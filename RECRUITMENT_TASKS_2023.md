## Task ID: Chrome Tabs Organiser
#### `Chrome Extension`

Mentors: [Mardav Gandhi](https://github.com/marcdhi) ([+91 9033398366](https://wa.me/919033398366)), [Parth Mittal](https://github.com/mittal-parth) ([+91 9411327838](https://wa.me/919411327838))

Difficulty: `Medium-Hard`

### Description

Currently, Chrome offers a built-in feature for grouping tabs, allowing users to manually organize them, assign names, and assign colors. However, in this task, you will be creating a Chrome Extension that automates this process, making tab management more efficient.

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

1. Create a Chrome Extension that automatically groups tabs from the same website under a single bar. Ensure that the extension recognizes the context by naming the bar after the visited website or page automatically.
2. Implement a feature to assign colors to tabs that match the theme of the respective websites for visual organization.


### Bonus Feature:

Implement context recognition from different websites and then group them together automatically. For example, if the user is browsing `web3` content but from different websites, group all of them under the name of a `web3` tab with a default color.
**NOTE**: Implementing this feature would result in this task being treated as a `Hard` task.

### Tips
1. Begin by understanding the basics of Chrome Extensions development. Refer to the Chrome Extension Documentation for a solid foundation.
2. Familiarize yourself with the Tabs API to manipulate and manage tabs programmatically.
3. Explore the concept of Contextual Identity to handle contextual tab grouping effectively.
